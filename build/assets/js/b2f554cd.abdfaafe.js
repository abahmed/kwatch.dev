kwatch?\\n\\nkwatch is an open-source project that started late in 2021.\\nIt aims to help you monitor all changes in your Kubernetes(K8s) cluster,\\ndetect crashes in your running apps, and publish notifications to your favorite channels (Slack, Discord, etc.) in real-time.\\n\\n**In this tutorial, I will help you setup and deploy kwatch on your Kubernetes cluster.**\\n**Plus, integrate with Slack to get notified on a channel when there is a crash in your apps.**\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Configure kwatch with Slack\\n\\nFirst of all, we need to get the webhook URL of the channel you want the notification to be received on it.\\n\\n*If you know how to generate the webhook URL you can escape this part and go to the configuration section.*\\n\\n**Step 1: create a new slack channel (if you don\'t have one already)**\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n**Step 2: Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create an app from scratch and connect it with your workplace**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n**Step 3: Create an incoming webhook and activate it**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n**Step 4: Connect it to you channel**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nFinally we have the webhook URL for the channel!\\n\\n\\n**Step 5: Get Configuration**\\n\\nGet the configuration template\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl  -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abahmed/kwatch/v0.3.0/deploy/config.yaml -o config.yaml\\n```\\n\\n**Step 6: Edit config.yaml with the corresponding configs**\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Namespace\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kwatch\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ConfigMap\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kwatch\\n  namespace: kwatch\\ndata:\\n  config.yaml: |\\n    alert:\\n      slack:\\n        webhook: WEBHOOK_URL\\n```\\n\\n**Step 7: Apply Configuration**\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f config.yaml\\n```\\n\\n## Deploy kwatch\\n\\nDeploy kwatch on your cluster with one command\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abahmed/kwatch/v0.3.0/deploy/deploy.yaml\\n```\\n\\nAfter deploying you will get notified on the channel that kwatch has started successfully. Now, kwatch is monitoring your apps!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHere is an example of kwatch messages when a crash is detected.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./../../img/blog/kwatch-slack/6.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n*If you like kwatch, give it a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/abahmed/kwatch)!*\\n\\n*We are happy to hear feedback from you and if you have any request, or suggestion don\'t hesitate to ping us on our channels ([Discord](https://discord.gg/kzJszdKmJ7), [GitHub](https://github.com/abahmed/kwatch))*"},{"id":"what-is-kwatch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-is-kwatch","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-05-what-is-kwatch.mdx","title":"What is kwatch?","description":"kwatch helps you monitor all changes in your Kubernetes(K8s) cluster,","date":"2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"kwatch","permalink":"/blog/tags/kwatch"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":0.14,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahman Ahmed","title":"Owner of kwatch","url":"https://github.com/abahmed","imageURL":"https://github.com/abahmed.png","key":"abahmed"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-is-kwatch","title":"What is kwatch?","authors":["abahmed"],"tags":["kwatch","kubernetes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Detect crashes in your Kubernetes cluster using kwatch and Slack","permalink":"/blog/detect-crashes-in-your-cluster-using-kwatch-and-slack"}},"content":"[kwatch](https://github.com/abahmed/kwatch) helps you monitor all changes in your Kubernetes(K8s) cluster,\\ndetects crashes in your running apps in realtime,\\nand publishes notifications to your channels (Slack, Discord, etc.) instantly"}]}')}}]);
