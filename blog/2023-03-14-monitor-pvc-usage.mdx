In this tutorial, I will help you set up and deploy kwatch on your Kubernetes
cluster to monitor Persistent Volumes (PV) usage and detect crashes in your running apps.

Plus, integrate with Teams to get notified on a channel when volume usage is higher than a threshold.

You can integrate with your favorite channel as
[kwatch](https://github.com/abahmed/kwatch) supports integrations with (Slack,
Discord, Email, PagerDuty, Telegram, Rocket Chat, Mattermost, Opsgenie, Matrix,
DingTalk, FeiShu, And Custom webhook).

### Configure kwatch with Teams

**Step 1: Get webhook**

First of all, we need to get the webhook URL of the channel you want the notification to be received on it.
([Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1)
is how to get it)

**Step 2: Get Configuration**

Get the configuration template

```bash
curl  -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abahmed/kwatch/v0.9.5/deploy/config.yaml -o config.yaml
```

**Step 3: Edit config.yaml with the corresponding config**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kwatch
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kwatch
  namespace: kwatch
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alert:
      teams:
        webhook: WEBHOOK_URL
    pvcMonitor:
      enabled: true
      interval: 5
      threshold: 70
```

For more configurations check [here](https://kwatch.dev/docs/pvc-monitor-configuration)

**Step 4: Apply Configuration**

```bash
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
```

### Deploy kwatch

Deploy kwatch on your cluster with one command

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abahmed/kwatch/v0.9.5/deploy/deploy.yaml
```

After deploying you will get notified on the channel that kwatch has started
successfully. Now, kwatch is monitoring your volumes and apps!

Here is an example of kwatch messages when volume usage exceeds the threshold
